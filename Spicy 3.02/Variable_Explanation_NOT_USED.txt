Plans:
Bugs:
- BUG: Prevent taunt sounds from stopping stroking message
- BUG: Invalid width/length picture display
- BUG: Fix halloween bosses
Code:
- Start Stroking file instead of vocab to not have everyline duplicated just for the sake of the metronome
Dialogue:
- Start dialogues
- Chastity Links
- End dialogues
- More Taunts
- More interactive stuff such as bind balls/penis, ice water, butt plug, kneel, stand, other position, colar, icy hot, pegs
- Ask to buy stuff, for example I'd do anything script
Ass training:
- Enema daily with increasing sizes
- Butt plug for x hours/night with increasing size
- Dildo fuck for x hours with increasing size
Planning:
- Tell her what days/nights you need to sleep well / are busy
Tasks:
- Night Tasks
 - No peeing (otherwise pee in bottle, consume?), cuff hands/feet, bind to bed/bondage, butt plug, vibrator, sleep on ground, sleep without pillow
- Daily Tasks/Weekly tasks
 - Wear panties, wear a max of x clothes, wear butt plug, wear vibrator, stinging nettle play, be always naked/lingerie when doing x
Settings for fetishes:
- CEI, CBT, Assplay, Ass to mouth, pain (clamps etc.), pee
Modules:
- Blowjob: laying on bed with face hanging down -> spit in face, collect spit for later use
- Sound play
- Ice Water play
- Pee/milk enema
- Cum Modules: On pillow sleep with it, into panties and wear for x, into socks and wear for x, toothbrush
- More and advanced chastity tasks
- Set ass and chastity level at start if you already have some experience
- Peg play more advanced = ropes etc., attach weights?
General:
- Enforcing personality and asking/soft personality. Enforcing is only limited by disabled fetishes

#WORKS: Does calling variables like #MeritChangeNHigh really executed the whole script?
#WORKS: Does this work? "@NullResponse #DenialLevel @CallReturn(CR\End\Decide\DecideORStandard.txt)"
#WORKS: @Variable[#DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)]>[1] @NullResponse @ChangeVar[OTime]=[OTime]+[#Random(1,10)] @Goto(test)
#TODO: Implement responses properly
#TODO: Add tasks Custom\Tasks_NOT_USED
#TODO: Add challenges Custom\Miniscripts\Challenge_NOT_USED
#TODO: Finish sub birthday Interrupt\SpecialDays\SubBirthday.txt
#TODO: More tease modules/port from Miss Blue
#TODO: Different dildo sizes
#TODO: Punishment with chastity does not properly put on chastity, search for HasChastity
#TODO: Add the fixed you aren't allowed to talk thing
#TODO: Fix vocab error (locked images)
#TODO: EdgeATon: let domme decide how many edges you want to do
#TODO: Fix play sound keep stroking stopping the stroking metronome
#TODO: Small punishment (more hits and variety)
#TODO: No edge sound and vocab error where #StopStrokingEdge is called CR\Stroking\QuickEdge.txt, #HoldTheEdge vocab error too
#TODO: Move other stroke taunt files to own file too same as start stroking.
#TODO: Force greeting domme
#TODO: Ignore links after start and go to strokig directly

Does it work? @RT(@ShowVar[BlackmailName1],@ShowVar[BlackmailName2],@ShowVar[BlackmailName3]) 

Notes about scripting:
@Flag / @NotFlag checks for a flag and supports multiple flags at once @Flag(test, test2) @Goto(flagsAreTrue)
@FlagOr continues of one of the flags exist @FlagOr(test1, test2, test3)
@SetFlag/@DeleteFlag Supports multiple flags at once
Behaviour with vocab files: Picked randomly between all lines that are "true"/valid (flag checks etc.)
@SetDate can be in one line multiple times
#DateDifference(Date, Seconds) can only be once in a line otherwise vocab error
@NullResponse @Variable[GNMMerits]>[1000] @SetVar[GNMMerits]=[1000] works. No need for @Variable[GNMMerits]>[1000] @NullResponse @SetVar[GNMMerits]=[1000]
@ShowVar[#DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)] does not work! Just use #DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)
#Vocab can also be used after nullresponse and does not require any output
@SetVar is not required, @ChangeVar can also create a variable, @Flag(Personality1) @NullResponse @SetVar[BJTraining]=[0] @ChangeVar[BJTraining]=[BJTraining]+[#Random(20,45)] does not work! Sets variable to 0 but no change
You can use vocabs in vocabfiles
You can only use ChangeVar when using another variable in the equation (can be used to create new vars though) Example: @ChangeVar[Test]=[Test1]*[2]
You can only use SetVar when assigning just a value and no equation is present Example: @SetVar[Test]=[0]
@CustomMode(done, Goto, Continue2) @Wait(999999) goes to when a message contains done is written. "Done Mistress", or just "done" for example.
@RapidCodeOn works infront of normal messages to make them display instantly. However it does NOT work with answers: [slut] @RapidCodeOn okay @Goto(test)

Important Setup:
All tagged sets must contain at least one picture with each tag (fully dressed, halfdressed etc.)
Session length from 600 - 1200 and no domme decide based on level! Restart tease ai every 600 minutes!
